                  In 1982, SCOTUS said that government officials had "qualified immunity" from civil rights lawsuits if they didn't violate "clearly established rights". These are rights detailed in the Constitution and Bill of Rights or in prior court cases. This protects police officers and other government officials from being prosecuted for crimes that anyone else would be charged for. For example, officers have gotten away with killing a 10-year-old boy, allegedly stealing $225K, and tear-gassing an innocent woman's house- all under the guise of qualified immunity. The Ending Qualified Immunity Act is especially relevant in today's tumultuous and frustrating times as black people are already heavily mistreated by police. On top of this, qualified immunity is just another safety net for cops to fall back on when they do something wrong. In this email, you're asking your district senators to tell our state Congresspeople that we care about this bill that you want to bring reform to the police.
