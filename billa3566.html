                    By now, there is no doubt you've heard of the George Floyd case- Floyd, a black man, was killed by a white police officer who cut off his breathing for nearly nine minutes. While this case has caused a great surge of awareness to the Black Lives Matter movement, there are so many more cases that fly under the radar. In July of 2018, four black teenagers were detained by the police after a call claimed that they had knives and had assaulted a man. No such thing had happened. And you may have heard of Amy Cooper, who recently called the cops on a black man, Chris Cooper, saying that he was "threatening her life". He was only bird-watching. Cooper falsely reported an incident to the police simply because of the color of Chris' skin. Under this bill, this, and other situations like it, would be classified as a hate crime.  By letting your legislators and local leaders know you want this bill introduced and passed in MD, you are helping bring justice to people of color in your state.
