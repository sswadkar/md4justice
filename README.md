# md4justice
md4justice.com is a website where any Marylander can email their local officials about bills they want to be passed by filling out their name, the name of the bill they wish to send an email about, and their address. The website utilizes Google Civic Information to find the user's district's representative on their machine without sending it to any server. Inputting your home address is optional, and if the user chooses to, they can fill out their information in the email they send to their representative. md4justice.com utilizes mailto links so that users can access personalized prewritten email templates and send them from their own email address to their representative.
