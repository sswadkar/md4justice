                  Anton’s Law is a bill that seeks to modernize standards for the use of deadly force by officers and would reform the Maryland Public Information Act, which prevents some information from being shared with the public while shielding personnel files of police officers. It would also remove privileges that currently allow police officers only to be interrogated and investigated by sworn officers and would establish police use-of-force standards. The bill is named after 19-year old Anton Black, who died in September of 2018 after a struggle with three Greensboro police officers. Although this bill would bring much-needed reform to the law enforcement system in Maryland, it has been languishing in committee for months. Due to recent events, the bill has gained more traction and there is some hope that it may get passed.
