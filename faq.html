    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <body>
      <button class="accordion">When I click the send button it opens up a blank tab or quickly opens and closes a tab, how do I fix this?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Here's a <a style="color:black;" href="https://youtu.be/bxw2jSg49KY">video</a> that explains how to configure your browser settings so you can easily open mailto links so you can send an email to your representative.  </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">How can I help?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Our entire system is based on the idea that as one united force, we can truly make a difference. Many of the ideas we use for our emails are suggested to us by people. Informing us, using the contact page, about new bills and ideas can help fuel our next proposal. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Why do I need to input a home address?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Inputting your home address or a home address near you allows us to determine who your district’s representative is and it also helps avoid auto-reply emails asking for your address. Representatives often only listen to their constituent's concerns and will ask for your address to confirm you are their constituent. Using a zip code isn’t always accurate, and so, if you were to send an email to a district’s representative that isn’t yours, they might not voice your concerns due to you not being their constituent. This is where the home address comes into play, as using this address will help us return your district’s representative’s email with little to no error.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Where is my home address going when I click send?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Once you click send, our website determines your district representative’s email address through a Google service (<a style="color:black;" href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Google Civic Information</a>). This avoids sending your address anywhere and the process of using your address to find your district’s representative’s email is completely local, which means that it is done on your machine. Your address is also put in the email you are sending so that your representative knows that you are their constituent. If you still wish to not input your address, you can find your district representative’s email address someplace else and input it manually into our site.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">When I click send, why is the email address of the recipient empty?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If this is the case, then that means the address you have inputted is not that of a home. The API we use allows us to determine your district and therefore your district’s representative’s email without having to send your address anywhere. Unfortunately, this is not foolproof and this requires us to use home addresses. If using your home address still doesn’t work, please improve this site by directly reporting this to <a style="color:black;" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFpFTOkTpm0YoerLLprY_ySS9PRXLsu27SM01hebHqkefW2Q/viewform">Google Civic Information</a> as they’ll be able to fix this problem.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">I have an idea for a bill that could be added to this website, how do I reach out to you about it?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Click the <a style="color:black;" href="contactus.html">Contact Us</a> tab and in the reason for contacting select the option “Proposal to add a bill” so that we know that your email is a proposal. In your proposal, make sure to include the bill you want to be added, a paragraph description about the bill, and links where we can learn more about the bill.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion" style="border-radius: 0px 0px 10px 10px; border-bottom: 0px;">How do I find my district’s representative’s email?</button>
      <div style="border-radius: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" class="panel">
        <p>If you are comfortable inputting your address, you can simply do that and we'll find the email for you. If not, you can use this <a style="color:black;" href="https://maryland.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=177afa87a67746a4ac5496b2d0897fb7">goverment approved website</a> to find your district’s representative and use this <a style="color:black;" href="https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/05sen/html/sendist.html">website</a> to find their email.</p>
